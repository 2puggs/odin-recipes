   <h1> MAC n CHEESE</h1>

   <img src="../baked-mac.jpeg" alt="Cheesy mac" style="width:340px;height:400px;">

   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>Mac & Cheese is a crowd favorite and there are many ways to make it. The way I propose is through a thick roux and baking more cheese in between layers of the shells covered in rich sauce. We don't skimp on butter or love here</p>

   <h3>Ingredients</h3>
   <ul>8 oz Colby Jack</ul>
   <ul>8 oz Sharp Cheddar</ul>
   <ul>Corkscrew Pasta</ul>
   <ul>Garlic Powder</ul>
   <ul>Salt</ul>
   <ul>Fresh Cracked Black Pepper</ul>
   <ul>Smoked Paprika</ul>
   <ul>All Purpose Flour</ul>
   <ul>Butter</ul>
   <ul>Milk</ul>

   <h3>Steps</h3>
   <ol>
   <li>Pre-head oven to 350 degrees F and butter a larger casserole dish.</li>
   <li>Cook noodles just shy of al dente. Drain well and do not rinse.</li>
   <li>In a new pot, melt the butter until foaming, slowly whisk in flower until bubbling.</li>
   <li>Whisk in milk, seasonings, and bring to boil. Remove from head and stir in half of combined shredded cheeses until melted.</li>
   <li>Add in noodles until combined, season with salt to desired taste. Pour into casserole dish. Layer with remaining cheese on top. </li>
   <li>Bake 25- 30 min. Broil for 2 min until crust forms. </li>
</ol>
